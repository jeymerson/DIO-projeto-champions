# Champions League API

An API that implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) themed around Champions League players and clubs. Developed with **TypeScript** and the **Express** framework, this API serves as a practice project for software architecture development.

## Features

The API provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations on two main resources:

**Players**:
   - `Create`: Adds new players to the database.
   - `Read`: Retrieves information about specific players or lists all players.
   - `Update`: Updates information of existing players.
   - `Delete`: Removes players from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Development platform used to build the API.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript, adding static typing to the code.
- **Express**: Minimalist framework for building web servers in Node.js.
